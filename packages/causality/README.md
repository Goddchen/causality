# causality

![main](https://github.com/Goddchen/causality/actions/workflows/main.yaml/badge.svg)
![Pub Version](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/causality)

## Motivation

I wanted to have a system in place that works like you would describe stuff
happening in the real world as well. Cause and effect came to my mind.

## Supported Features

- ✅ emit causes
- ✅ effects observe causes
- ✅ effects can result in new causes to be emitted

## Installation

As simple as `dart pub add causality`.

Or manually add `causality: ^<version>` to your `pubspec.yaml`.
