flutter_causality: ![Pub Version](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/flutter_causality)

## Motivation

I wanted to have a system in place that works like you would describe stuff
happening in the real world as well. Cause and effect came to my mind.

`causality` contains the pure Dart package and `flutter_causality` contains
the Flutter related extensions.

## Supported Features

### causality

- ✅ Emit causes
- ✅ Effects observe causes
- ✅ Effects can result in new causes to be emitted

### flutter_causality

- ✅ Put a causality universe widget in the wigdet tree
- ✅ Put an effect widget in the widget tree to observe causes
